# REST Countries API with color theme switcher

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my front-end coding project.

This project is the results of a front-end coding challenge I took on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)

## Description

The challenge was to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it in a web page.

In this challenge, I was allowed to use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as [React](https://reactjs.org) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org). I also had complete control over which packages to use to do things like make HTTP requests or style my project.

The goal of this project is to allow users to be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
- view the design on any screen size.
